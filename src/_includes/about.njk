            of a rock star development team.

            I enjoy writing about web design, and throughout this site share my experience as a front end developer
            working at the intersection of Big Data and Big Pharma.

            In my spare time I like to compose music, which I link to from the <a href="/playground">playground</a>
            along with all of my other side projects. I also spend a lot of time reading, mostly about web design and
            user experience with the occasional book on string theory or building time machines.

            I grew up in Harrisburg, PA and graduated from Temple University in 2007 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in
            Advertising and a minor in Sociology.
